/*! \mainpage Fresh - A Qt extension library

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<a href="http://bettercodes.org/projects/fresh/home/">Fresh</a> is a <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt</a> extension library.

As an extension library it add usefull \ref Core and \ref Gui classes to extend the possibilities offered by the excellent Qt.
It runs on any operating system supported by Qt (eg. Windows, UNIX/Linux, MacOS/X).

This documentation describes Fresh for Qt 4.

Fresh also includes language bindings for <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>. 
These require that <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/">PyQt</a> v4 is also installed.

This version of Fresh is based on Qt v4.7.1.

<h2>Licensing</h2>

Fresh is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General Public License v3</a>.
And allow both closed and open source applications to use it.

See the file "LICENSE" to see what license this copy of Fresh is released under.

<h2>Installation</h2>

As supplied Fresh will be built as a static library/DLL.
There is currently no install rules for the qmake version,
so once built you should include <tt>fresh.pri</tt> in your project.

To build Fresh, run:

<pre>
    qmake fresh.pro
    make
</pre>

If you have both Qt v3 and v4 installed then make sure you use the correct
version of <tt>qmake</tt>.

Depending on the compiler you are using you may need to run <tt>nmake</tt> rather than <tt>make</tt>.

<h2>Example Application</h2>

The example application provided demonstrate nearly all available classes in Fresh.

To build the example, run:

<pre>
    qmake subdirs.pro
    make
</pre>

On Windows (and depending on the compiler you are using) you may need to run <tt>nmake</tt> rather than <tt>make</tt>.


<h2>Python Bindings</h2>

TO BE UPDATED BY HLAMER

The Python bindings are in the <tt>Python</tt> directory.  You must have either
PyQt v3 or v4 already installed.  QScintilla must also already be built and
installed.

The configure, build and install the bindings, run:

<pre>
    python configure.py
    make
    make install
</pre>

On Windows (and depending on the compiler you are using) you may need to run <tt>nmake</tt> rather than <tt>make</tt>.

By default the bindings will be built for PyQt v4 if it is installed.  If not,
they will be built against PyQt v3.  If you have both installed and want to
build against PyQt v3 then pass <tt>-p 3</tt> as an argument to
<tt>configure.py</tt>.

<tt>configure.py</tt> supports a number of other arguments.  Pass <tt>-h</tt>
to display a list of the supported arguments.


<h2>Qt Designer Plugin (not yet available)</h2>

Fresh includes an optional plugin for Qt Designer that allows Fresh widgets to be included in GUI designs just like any other Qt widget.

To build the plugin on all platforms, make sure Fresh is installed and then run (as root or administrator):

<pre>
    qmake designer.pro
    make
    make install
</pre>

On Windows (and depending on the compiler you are using) you may need to run <tt>nmake</tt> rather than <tt>make</tt>.
